### About Me

Hello I'm David, a Junior Software Developer in the making 👋🏻

I've recently completed my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (Advanced Front-End) from the Code Institute, awaiting my final results.

I enjoy coding and design and am currently looking for a career change in this direction.
When I'm not working or coding, I can be found either exerciseing 💪🏃 (I'm currently designing a workout journal website to pair my love of coding and fitness), in the great outdoors 🚵 or, most importantly spending time with my family 👨‍👩‍👦.
